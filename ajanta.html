            <p class="bold">Near Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India</p>
            <br>

            The Ajanta Caves and Ellora Caves represent two different periods of Indian history and artistry: <br>
           
            <br>
            - The Ajanta Caves date back to the 2nd century BCE to the 6th century CE and were primarily used by Buddhist monks as monastic retreats and prayer halls.
            - These caves contain some of the finest examples of ancient Indian art and are famous for their exquisite frescoes and paintings that depict scenes from the life of Buddha, Jataka tales, and other Buddhist themes.
            - The caves at Ajanta are a testimony to the artistic and spiritual achievements of ancient India and its contributions to Buddhist art.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            - The Ellora Caves, on the other hand, span a more extended period, from the 6th century CE to the 10th century CE. They represent a fusion of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain cave temples.
- The complex consists of 34 caves, with 12 dedicated to Buddhism (the first group), 17 to Hinduism (the second group), and 5 to Jainism (the third group).
- The Kailash Temple, an architectural marvel within the Ellora Caves, is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is renowned for its monolithic structure carved out of a single rock.
